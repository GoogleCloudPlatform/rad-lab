# Deploy a Module

This is the primary flow and purpose for RAD Lab UI. A step-by-step graphical interface will prompt you for the variables needed to deploy the selected module to Google Cloud.

Admins and Users are both able to deploy modules.

## Prerequisites

Users can only deploy modules that Admins have explicitly published. If there are no options available, please talk to your Admin.

When an Admin is publishing a module, there may be a few admin-only variables for the Admin to provide. These will be merged in with the variables the User provides.

## The Process

1. A User (or Admin) selects a module they wish to deploy (e.g. Data Science)
1. They are prompted for all the required variables needed to deploy
    - Some variables may already be provided as defaults
1. The user submits 
1. A Cloud Build job will be started to deploy the resources
   1. A unique Deployment ID for the deployment will be generated
   1. A new Google Cloud project will be created using this Deployment ID
   1. A deployment folder in GCS will be created (within the Admin configured bucket)
   1. Terraform files will be written to the folder including a variables file consisting of the Admin and User provided variables
1. The User will be taken to a page representing their deployment
1. The user will see the deployment in the "Running" status
    - The status may change over time. The possible statuses and their explanations can be seen [here](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/api/reference/rest/v1/projects.builds#status)
1. After some time (up to 1 hour), the deployment will complete, fail, or time out
    - Logs of the build will be streamed to monitor status or troubleshoot errors
