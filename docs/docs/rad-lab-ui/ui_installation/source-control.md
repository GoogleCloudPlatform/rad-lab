# Source Control

We recommend forking the official [RAD Lab repository](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/rad-lab), to ensure that your organization keeps full control over the codebase.  For now, RAD Lab only supports GitHub, but this may change in the future.  When pushing the code to GitHub, ensure that it's configured to work together with the [Cloud Build integration](https://github.com/marketplace/google-cloud-build).  

:::tip GitHub Actions
It's a good idea to remove the `.github` folder (or create a backup) initially, as otherwise you may receive several failed build emails.
:::

Make a note of your new GitHub repository URL, as you will need it when going through the next steps.
