    "Funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and proudly operated by Battelle, the [National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)](https://www.neonscience.org/) program provides open, continental-scale data across the United States that characterize and quantify complex, rapidly changing ecological processes. The Observatoryâ€™s comprehensive design supports greater understanding of ecological change and enables forecasting of future ecological conditions. NEON collects and processes data from field sites located across the continental U.S., Puerto Rico, and Hawaii over a 30-year timeframe. NEON provides free and open data that characterize plants, animals, soil, nutrients, freshwater, and the atmosphere. These data may be combined with external datasets or data collected by individual researchers to support the study of continental-scale ecological change.\n",

    "This notebook is a demonstration of accessing and querying NEON data stored in Google Cloud BigQuery. Only a small subset of NEON data are currently available in this format, but more may be added in the future. The example datasets used are [Continuous discharge (DP4.00130.001)](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP4.00130.001/RELEASE-2022) and [Chemical properties of surface water (DP1.20093.001)](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.20093.001/RELEASE-2022). The RELEASE-2022 versions of both data products are available in BigQuery tables via the Analytics Hub. In both cases, we'll be focusing on the critical data table (csd_continuousDischarge and swc_externalLabDataByAnalyte, respectively) but other data and metadata tables are also available in the Analytics Hub listing. For more details about the two data products, see the product details pages at the links above, and the variables tables in each Analytics Hub listing.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two data products can be used together to estimate nutrient fluxes in stream ecosystems. In this notebook we first demonstrate a query on each data product independently, then a query that brings the two together to estimate dissolved organic carbon fluxes across NEON's stream sites.\n",

    "A few notes on this demo. This was a simple exercise for illustration purposes, not a rigorous analysis. We calculated the DOC flux on each day when DOC was sampled, but the continuous discharge data are available on a 1-minute resolution. More typical for this type of analysis would be to build a model estimating the flux as a function of discharge, and use the high-resolution discharge data to extrapolate a total flux estimate for the entire year.\n",

    "Similarly, there are many possible pathways to take regarding how much aggregation and data cleaning to carry out in the query step, as opposed to querying broadly and doing the data wrangling in the analysis phase. Choosing what to do in which part of the process depends on the nature of the analysis, and on familiarity with the data and data structures. In general, applying extensive data cleaning in the query step makes processing and analysis faster, by taking advantage of BigQuery's high speed performance and capabilities, but at the risk of missing critical nuance in the data. For example, if we didn't know to retain only the records where `dischargeFinalQF=0`, the daily mean discharge estimate from the query would include data that had been flagged as erroneous. As with all analyses, explore the data carefully before choosing an analytical approach."
